# blood-donation-management-system

This project is developed to manage blood donation. A blood donation occurs when a person
voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions or made into biopharmaceutical
medications by a process called fractionation (separation of whole-blood components). Donation
may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly. In this project, we are here to help
those people who are in need of blood. In the user interface, new blood details can enter into the
project to manage blood request. Then donor details can also be entered and maintained in the
database. There is a registration page for becoming a donor, anyone can request from this
project. So after all our project can be used to serve importantly and efficiently to all the people
who are looking for blood.
